"tic tac toe" [Demo](https://blue-moon02.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)<br><br>
In addition to tic-tac-toe challenges, reset and play again buttons are added. Technically, both are same. Reset button appears all the time but play again shows up only when te game is over (i.e. either draw or win/lose).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### How to start the app?

Go to the app root directory and run: `npm start`

It will start the development server. App will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
